\section{\MakeUppercase{Introduction}}
    We use \textbackslash gls\{tu\} as defined in \textit{acronym.tex} to insert acronyms like \gls{tu}. This will auto-insert used acronyms in List of Abbreviations. The first instance of the abbreviation will show its full form with short form inside braces but further instances like \gls{tu} will show short form only.
    \subsection{Background}
    We use \textbackslash cite\{einstein1905\} as defined in \textit{refs.bib} to cite works \cite{einstein1905}. This will automatically insert used bibliography at the references section. You'll need to insert BibTeX in \textit{refs.bib} for this to work.
    \subsection{Motivation}
    Use \textbackslash autoref\{label-name\} to reference figures, tables, sections, equations and so on like \autoref{fig:logotu}, \autoref{tab:sample}, \autoref{sec:appendices} and \autoref{eqn:integral}.
    \subsection{Problem Definition}
